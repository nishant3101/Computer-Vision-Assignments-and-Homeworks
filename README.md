# Computer-Vision-Assignments-and-Homeworks
This repository contains all the codes related to the assignments and homeworks I did for the course Computer Vision (CSE344 / ECE344). 

**Welzl Algorithm- Assignment-1.py** detects all the individual objects in grayscale image, finds a minimum bounding circle for each one of them and evaluates the accuracy of the bounding circle using Jaccard similarity. The minimum bounding circle is computed using Welzl algorithm. 

**CV_homeworks_notebook.ipynb** contains the codes from most of the homeworks and a couple of assignments. 

**Contrast and Spatial cues-Assignment 2.py** implements algorithm for finding contrast cue and spatial cue from an RGB image. Contrast cue and Spatial cue halps in Image co-saliency and co-segmentation. More can be read at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236581375_Cluster-Based_Co-Saliency_Detection. It further implements those cues using a metric called "separation measure" to obtain quality score for the two cues. Further can be read about this at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321796205_Quality-Guided_Fusion-Based_Co-Saliency_Estimation_for_Image_Co-Segmentation_and_Colocalization.

**Region Segmentation-Assignment 2.py** implements region segmentation on an RGB image using Fuzzy c-means algorithm. 

**Assignment-3.ipynb** uses MNIST dataset to develop individual Deep learning models that performs
a) Foreground extraction
b) Classification along with circlization
c) Semantic segmentation
