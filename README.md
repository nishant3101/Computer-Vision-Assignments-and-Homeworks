# Computer-Vision-Assignments-and-Homeworks
This repository contains all the codes related to the assignments and homeworks I did for the course Computer Vision (CSE344 / ECE344). 

Welzl Algorithm- Assignment-1.py detects all the individual objects in grayscale image, finds a minimum bounding circle for each one of them and evaluates the accuracy of the bounding circle using Jaccard similarity. The minimum bounding circle is computed using Welzl algorithm. 

CV_homeworks_notebook.ipynb contains the codes from most of the homeworks and a couple of assignments.
